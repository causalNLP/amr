You are a professional linguist. You are asked to generate the abstract meaning representation (AMR) for each of the following sentences. You will double check the AMRs to make sure that they are all valid, such as (1) having no duplicate node names within each AMR itself, and (2) the parentheses always match. Note that the "Sentence 2" is always a valid sentence, so you should try your best to generate its AMR no matter what text sequence you see.

Sentence 1: I really especially hate those who are eating Chinese things and drinking Chinese things, but who say America is so whatever, those dogs, if America is so good go find your American illegitimate fathers.
